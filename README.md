# Catch The Egg

## 📘 Project Overview
**Catch The Egg** is a Level 1 Term 1 project developed in **C and C++**. The project involves a fun and interactive game where players control a character to catch falling eggs while avoiding obstacles. This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts like **graphics programming**, **event handling**, and **basic game logic**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Control a character to catch falling eggs and avoid obstacles.
- **Graphics Programming**: Uses 2D graphics to create a visually engaging game environment.
- **Game Mechanics**: Points system and difficulty progression as the game advances.
- **Simple Controls**: Easy-to-learn keyboard-based controls for smooth gameplay.

## 📂 Project Structure
The main components of the repository are organized as follows:
```
├── src                  # Source code for the C/C++ files
├── assets               # Game assets such as images and sounds
├── build                # Compiled binaries and executables
├── README.md            # Project documentation
└── Makefile             # File to build and compile the project
```

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: C, C++
- **Graphics Library**: Custom 2D graphics built with low-level C/C++ graphics libraries
- **Development Tools**: GCC compiler, Makefile for project build automation

## 🔧 Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following software installed before running the project:
- **GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)**: To compile C/C++ source code.
- **Make**: To run the Makefile and build the project.

## 📥 Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Sadif-Ahmed/Catch-The-Egg.git
   cd Catch-The-Egg
   ```
2. **Build the Project**:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
3. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   ./catch_the_egg
   ```

## 📚 Usage Instructions
1. Launch the game by running the `catch_the_egg` executable.
2. Use keyboard controls (e.g., arrow keys) to move the character left and right.
3. Catch as many falling eggs as possible while avoiding obstacles.
4. Score points for every egg caught. Try to achieve the highest score!

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Graphics**: Improve graphics with higher-quality sprites and animations.
- **New Levels**: Introduce new levels with increasing difficulty.
- **Power-Ups and Bonuses**: Add special power-ups to make the gameplay more exciting.
- **Sound Effects**: Include background music and sound effects for a more immersive experience.
